# Categorizing Wine Quality 

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed
- Make sure the data is downloaded via the proper data source. 
    - Please make sure down [download the zip file](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) into the project directory and unzip. Unziping will create another directory called `wine+quality` which will contain the two datasets that's needed for this notebook to function.
## Steps to Run
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Or if using JupyterLab:
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```
4. In the Jupyter interface, navigate to and open the notebook file (*.ipynb)
5. Select "Kernel" > "Restart & Run All" to execute all cells in order

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter missing package errors, ensure all required packages are installed ( packages should be automatically installed as defined in the first cell )
- For kernel errors, try restarting the kernel
- Make sure all data files referenced in the notebook are in the correct relative paths

## Notes
- Code cells can be run individually by selecting them and pressing Shift+Enter
- Markdown cells can be edited by double-clicking them
- Save your work periodically using the save button or Ctrl+S
